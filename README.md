# Kanban Markdown

A VSCode/Cursor extension that brings a full-featured kanban board directly into your editor. Features are stored as human-readable markdown files, making them version-controllable and easy to edit outside the board.

## Kanban Skill

Install the [kanban-skill](https://github.com/LachyFS/kanban-skill) via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) to give your AI agent full context of your board and the ability to create, update, and move features directly from the terminal. Works with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and any skills.sh-compatible agent.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/LachyFS/kanban-skill
```

  { "id": "in-progress", "name": "In Progress", "color": "#f59e0b" },
  { "id": "review", "name": "Review", "color": "#8b5cf6" },
  { "id": "done", "name": "Done", "color": "#22c55e" }
]
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development (watch mode)
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit + component tests (fast, no VS Code host required)
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Integration tests (launches a real VS Code instance)
pnpm test:integration
```

Unit tests cover shared logic, extension utilities, and React components. Integration tests run inside a VS Code host using `@vscode/test-electron` and exercise the real file system and VS Code APIs.

#### Running the CI pipeline locally with `act`

[`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) runs GitHub Actions workflows locally in Docker.

```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install act

# Run the full CI test job
act push -j test --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

The first run downloads a VS Code binary (~160 MB) into `.vscode-test/` which is cached for subsequent runs.

### Debugging

1. Press `F5` in VSCode to launch the Extension Development Host
2. Open the command palette and run "Open Kanban Board"
3. Make changes and reload the window (`Cmd+R`) to see updates

### Tech Stack

**Extension**: TypeScript, VSCode API, esbuild
**Webview**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Tiptap
